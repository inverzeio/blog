# Becoming "Atomic Hard" in 2026 - Applying Atomic Habits and 75 Hard

Yes, I chalked up many - rather ambitious - goals, where I want to be in the best 10% of the general population - in a lot of things. Just skip to the Goals if are ready for mockery. 

### Atomic Habits Loop - CCRR
**Cue → Craving → Response → Reward**
1. **Cue**  **triggers** your brain to initiate an action
2. **Craving**  the **motivation/desire** that makes you want to act
3. **Response**  the actual **habit** you perform
4. **Reward**  the **satisfaction** you get, which reinforces the loop

It's worthwhile to build habits around this loop. New habits form best if they are part of your identity. Daily 1% Improvements add up to 37x improvements over a year.

### My 75 Hard High Level Rules
- Follow a structured **Diet** with no cheat meals 
- Complete **two** 45-minute **Workouts** each day, at least **one outdoors**
- Add 5 **Exercise Snacks** to your day
- **Drink** 3 liters of **water** daily
- **Sleep** well every day
- **Take Supplements** if needed
- **Read**, **Learn** and **Listen** every day
- **Write** and **Code** each day
- Make positive changes by **Socializing**, **Helping someone**, **Improving your environment** every day
- **Proud of the day? Probably a make or break of success!**
- Take a daily **Progress Photo** and
- **If you fail to complete any task, you must start over from day one**
