<p><em>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” “When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’</em>
Edward Snowden</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone, that internet giants are tracking all your actions - <em>what the hell, even I started this website by adding Google Analytics to it. Yes. I`ll shamelessly collect your information, if you let me to :) I suggest you, however to do the right thing and follow through my tips</em> - but the question is, how accurate are these trackers?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out they are pretty accurate. The more data the average Joe(you? Better not be you…:) 😀) hand them willingly, the better idea they will have about you, your habits, your secrets, social life, interests, ambitions. So much so, that they might know more about you, than you think you know about yourself.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-privacy">What is privacy</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">Privacy</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">option</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">keep</span> <span class="n">things</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">yourself</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">people</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">choosing</span><span class="o">.</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>It is an innate human need. Although (with so many things nowadays) having rights is important, it doesn’t mean anything without practical applications. You have the right to use the bathroom in a closed hotel room, but it feels intrusive to know, you might be observed during your private moments. Loosing the option to exercise your right to privacy is unacceptable, and must be fought against.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-anonymity">What is anonymity</h2>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="no">Anonymity</span> <span class="n">means</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">throughout</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">actions</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">your</span> <span class="n">identity</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="kp">protected</span><span class="o">.</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>You don’t need to be doing anything wrong yet you might prefer to stay anonymous. Anonymity is advantageous when your actions, or collective of actions could cause you indirect (economic or other) harm. We have entered an age, where …….</p>
