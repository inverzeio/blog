<p>In the first chapter we find some interesting insights about the history of human operated ransomware groups, their recent activities, tooling, and a high level overview of how different groups were associated with each other. Also a brief summary of the famous indictments - the cases that have been solved and linked to a known individual or group.</p>

<p>Then, we get a good introduction of the NIST Cyber Incident Process and the authorâ€™s take on how does it apply to several cases. Oleg Skulkin goes in a quite long, but well condensed summary of a number of different campaigns, and their most commonly used tactics, techniques and procedures(TTPs). Although, this may not be new to seasoned CTI professionals, it definitely give a lot of different insights to other cybersecurity professionals, including MITRE ATT&amp;CKÂ® Explanations as well to describe the tradecraft. Obviously a book of this volume cannot go into the very in-depth analysis of each campaign, but the external references provide a very good opportunity to dive deeper.</p>

<p>One can argue, that a lot of the content can be found in the reports alone, however, it is still valuable to have the whole arsenal of TTPs collected. It is definitely the highlight of the book, which endows the reader with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of Ransomware operations.</p>

<p>The second most insightful part of the book starts with the Practical IR at Chapter 7. This gives a good overview of all the Digital Forensics techniques that can be used to obtain evidence, the key artifacts, and most of the tools IR professionals use. Every new topic starts with explanations that are welcoming for the novice readers as well.</p>

<p>Overall, the DFIR artifact session is a good intro / refresher for all (except pro) levels of practitioners. This can be obviously discussed in volumes, so most are mentioned, but the reader should definitely do some additional digging to acquire fluency with the artifacts - they span from Event logs to $MFT, from shellbags to volatile memory.</p>

<p>The Investigation chapters then break down most common (human operated or else automated) techniques, that can be used to investigate not just ransomware type of security incidents. Again, great to see a summary that Security Engineers and Analysts can use to understand a wider variety of attacks.</p>

<p>The book does a very good job at showcasing a lot of different techniques in detail, with ransomware-relevancy. Most of the times the evidence presented are easy to be interpreted, however, sometimes the conclusions drawn are one-liners, where we have to believe that the conclusion is correct - which is easy because the author presents the evidences in a very factual way.</p>

<p>The Post-Exploitation, Data Exfil and Deployment techniques are definitely giving great insights on where you should focus your investigation when putting the puzzle pieces together - it is easy to forget about some of those artifacts.</p>

<p>The book closes with explaining how the different models(Cyber KillÂ®, MITRE ATT&amp;CKÂ®, The Unified Kill Chain) lead to the Unified Ransomware Kill Chain - which is a novelty by the author and signifies the repeated nature of Key Assets discovery, Network Propagation, Data Exfiltration in the Kill Chain.</p>

<p>The book is well written, and for seasoned infosec professionals will be a relatively easy read with plenty of good reminders on subjects, some informative statistics,  external references, and some novel thinking around the killchain.</p>

<p>The recommendation for a second edition or part II, would be to expand more on the possibilities for using decryptors, typical response scenarios, and proactive mitigation - even though itâ€™s hard to fill so much information in just one book.</p>
